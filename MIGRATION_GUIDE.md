# 🚀 Database Migration Guide

## ❌ Current Issue
Your task management app is missing database columns for enhanced features like:
- Due dates for tasks
- Member assignments  
- Reminder system
- Task tracking

## ✅ Solution: Run the Migration

### **Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find and click on your project: `lvplhlzzwtrqjdxhjrkd`

### **Step 2: Open SQL Editor**
1. In the left sidebar, click **"SQL Editor"**
2. Click **"New query"** to create a blank query

### **Step 3: Run the Migration**
1. Open the file `MIGRATION.sql` in your project
2. **Copy ALL the SQL code** (lines 1-54)
3. **Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor**
4. Click the **"Run"** button (▶️)

### **Step 4: Verify Success**
You should see output like:
```
Success. No rows returned
```

### **Step 5: Test the Migration**
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
cd "/Users/gabrielrios/Desktop/WebDevProjects/project managment app" && node scripts/test-enhanced-features.cjs
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After running the migration:
- ✅ All database errors will disappear
- ✅ Date pickers will become functional  
- ✅ Member assignment dropdowns will work
- ✅ Reminder system will be active
- ✅ Task tracking features enabled

## 🔧 What the Migration Does

1. **Adds new columns** to `checklist_items` table:
   - `due_date` - For task deadlines
   - `assigned_to` - For user assignments
   - `reminder_date` - For reminder scheduling
   - `reminder_interval` - For reminder frequency
   - `reminder_count` - For tracking reminders

2. **Creates functions**:
   - `list_workspace_members()` - Lists assignable users
   - `update_updated_at_column()` - Auto-updates timestamps

3. **Sets up permissions** for the new features

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is a **one-time migration**
- It's **safe to run multiple times** (uses `IF NOT EXISTS`)
- **No data will be lost**
- **Existing tasks remain unchanged**

## 🆘 If You Need Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that you're logged into the correct Supabase account
2. Make sure you're in the right project (`lvplhlzzwtrqjdxhjrkd`)
3. Verify you copied the complete SQL from `MIGRATION.sql`
4. Run the test script to verify everything works
